This program simulates the ancient game of Cho-Han with two players.
Players guess whether the dealer will roll an even total with two dice.
Points are awarded for each correct guess. The grand winner is displayed
after all rounds are played.

The original code is Gaddis9e Program 14-17 on pp. 876-884. You can find
